# 張誠華 Steven Chang  
---

I was a site director of HVAC(*Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning*) construction sites, had about 8 years of experience in HVAC related fields,
responsible for managing hundreds of workers 
and handling project budgets over 200,000,000 NT dollars.

Now I found my real passion in living—coding,  
wish I could build something nice, something meaningful,  
even make some contribution to this world.

<!--

It is a pre-order platform that helps people easily search foods, make orders or open stores.
  - Have frontstage and backstage of store page through Devise and Pundit Gem, with RESTful API design in advance.
  - Use AASM Gem to make transactions act as finite state machine.
  - Upload images to AWS S3 through Carrierwave Gem.
  - GitHub repository and docs: [https://github.com/order-brother/Order-Brother](https://github.com/order-brother/Order-Brother)

> Order brother, help you out like your older brother. -->

With the passion of work and life,  
I want to be better, and not just fine.
