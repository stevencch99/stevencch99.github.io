# 張誠華 Steven Chang  
---
I used to be a site director of HVAC*(Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)* construction sites,
have about 8 years of experience in HVAC related field.

Currently working on a Rails demo project: **[Order Brother](https://github.com/order-brother/Order-Brother)**.  
It is a pre-order platform that helps people easily search foods, make orders or open stores.

With all the passion for work and life,  
I want to be better, and not just fine,  
ready to prove my value at any time.  

I treat myself as my own executive,  
spare no effort to enhance work effectiveness,  
with my honesty, empathy, and integrity,  
the self-motivated, self-actualized,  
and the great sense of responsibility,  
I've trying to achieve something even greater,  
and as a result, that made me a good team player!
