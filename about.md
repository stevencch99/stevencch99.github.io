I am currently working on Rails development. 

Used to have more than 7 years of experience in HVAC related field,
with all the passion for work and life,
I want to be better, and not just fine,
ready to prove my value at any time.

I treat myself as my own executive,
spare no effort to enhance work effectiveness,
with my honesty,  empathy, and integrity, 
the self-motivated, self-actualized,
and the great sense of responsibility, 
I've trying to achieve something even greater, 
and as a result, that made me a good team player!
