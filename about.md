# 張誠華 Steven Chang

I have about 8 years of experience in HVAC related field, used to be a site director of HVAC*(Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)* construction sites, manage hundreds of workers and project budgets over two hundred million NT dollars.

Now I found my real passion in living -- coding, wish I could build something nice, something meaningful to contribute to the world.

- Rails demo project: **[Order Brother](https://github.com/order-brother/Order-Brother)**.  
It is a pre-order platform that helps people easily search foods, make orders or open stores.
  - Have frontstage and backstage of store page through Devise and Pundit Gem, with RESTful API design in advance.
  - Use AASM Gem to make transactions act as finite state machine.
  - Upload images to AWS S3 through Carrierwave Gem.
  - GitHub repository and docs: [https://github.com/order-brother/Order-Brother](https://github.com/order-brother/Order-Brother)
  - Deployed on Heroku: [https://order-brother.herokuapp.com](https://order-brother.herokuapp.com)

> Order brother, help you out like your older brother.

With all the passion for work and life,  
I want to be better, and not just fine,  
ready to prove my value at any time.  

I treat myself as my own executive,  
spare no effort to enhance work effectiveness,  
with my honesty, empathy, and integrity,  
the self-motivated, self-actualized,  
and the great sense of responsibility,  
I've trying to achieve something even greater,  
and as a result, that made me a good team player!
