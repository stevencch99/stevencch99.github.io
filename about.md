I am currently working on Rails development. 

Used to have about 8 years of experience in HVAC related field,  
with all the passion for work and life,  
I want to be better, and not just fine,  
ready to prove my value at any time.  

I treat myself as my own executive,  
spare no effort to enhance work effectiveness,  
with my honesty,  empathy, and integrity,  
the self-motivated, self-actualized,  
and the great sense of responsibility,  
I've trying to achieve something even greater,  
and as a result, that made me a good team player!
